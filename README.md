I have conducted an in-depth analysis of IMDb data(2006-2016) to uncover trends and insights in the world of film and entertainment.

Key Insights:

1. Christopher Nolan is the best director .
2. James Cameron made the most revenue as a director.
3. Not necessarily famous movies will make more revenue.
4. Even though in year 2016 most movies were produced but highest revenue generated in year 2016.
5. Most movies have runtime of (90-125)mins.
6. We can't possibly say if the rating is high, the movie will make more revenue but one thing we can see that the movies with (>400) revenue mostly have good ratings.
7. The Dark Night is the highest rated movie till now
8. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens has generated most revenue in the span of (2006-2016).

Limitation:

There were some missing values in the revenue and metascore column.I have removed them.
